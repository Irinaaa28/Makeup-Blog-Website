# Website-Project

## About

This is my first site with a makeup blog, made with HTML, CSS and JavaScript, for the people passioned with all about makeup. There people can find information about makeup history and most popular makeup brands and products.

## What I leraned
* the use of basic techniques in HTML and CSS
* the implementation of different functions in JavaScript
* creating a navbar, displaying photos, creating a form
* making a site responsive

## How it looks like

In the first video, there is the main page of my website. 

The current date appears after 5 seconds from opening the page and changes its color randomly every second. The "Aboneaza-te la newsletter" button changes its color, too, and the "Sa incepem" button changes its color right after putting the cursor on it.

In the following video, I made a dropdown menu for classifying brands in different categories.

In the next video, there are some popular makeup stores displayed in a specific page. As shown in the video, when a photo is clicked once, it appears again in the bottom of the page and if the same photo is clicked one more time, its clone disappears.
